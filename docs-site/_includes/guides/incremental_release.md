### Incremental release

Now we're ready to do an incremental release from blue to green. Right now the
default rules for `/api` send all traffic to blue. Letâ€™s introduce a small
percentage of green traffic to customers.

Navigate to [app.turbinelabs.io](https://app.turbinelabs.io), then click
"Release Groups" below the top-line charts. The row "server"
should be marked "RELEASE READY". Click anywhere in the row to expand it, then
click "Start Release".

Let's send 25% of traffic to our new green version by
moving the slider and clicking "Start Release". The release group should now
be marked "RELEASING".

The all in one client should now show a mix of blue and green. You can
increment the green percentage as you like. When you get to 100%, the release
is complete.

Congratulations! You've safely and incrementally released a new version of your
production software. Both blue and green versions are still running; if a
problem were found with green, a rollback to blue would be just as easy.
